# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product
This is the URLs page a logged in user might see. Only the urls create by the current logged in user are visible.

This is the register form a user might see. It is very similar to the login page.
