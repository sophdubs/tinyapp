# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product



## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcrypt
- body-parser
- cookie-session

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.

## Project Implementation
- This project required us to build an Express server and handle HTTP requests according to RESTful conventions. 
- I was able to ensure user security by hashing the passwords before storing them in the user database as well as encrypting the cookies.
- I decided to organise my project directory according to MVC conventions:
  - All data can be found in the models directory
  - All views can be found in the views directory
  - The controller is the express_server file
  - All helper functions have been factored out to their own file and fully tested. 
- I created a custom middleware, ensureCredentialsPresent, to handle incomming POST '/login' and POST '/register' requests. This middleware ensures the user filled out both the email and password fields before logging in or registering. If they have not, a page explaining the missing credentials is rendered. 
- I also played around with the style to keep the colors and forms more consistent.
